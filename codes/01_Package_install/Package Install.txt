1. install anaconda: (please install python 3.x)
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
(strongly recommend to install in your home not the root)

2. install CUDA and cuDNN (optional, for nVidia GPU users only)
    1). install cuda toolkit (TF only supports 8.0 now)
    https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
    
    2). install cuDNN (TF only supports 6.1 now):
    https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn
    * cuDNN doesn't need installation. Just unzip it and set the folder
    ./cudnn/bin to your system path, so other codes can reach the file
    cudnn65_5.dll directly. 
    
3. create Python envoriment (optional)
    It is strongly recommend to install your deep learning packages
    in an independent Python evnoriments. 
    
    For GPU users:
    $> conda create --name tensorflow-gpu python=3.6 anaconda
    
    For CPU users:
    $> conda create --name tensorflow python=3.6 anaconda

4. switch to your new conda evnoriments:
    For GPU users:
    $> activate tensorflow-gpu 
    
    For CPU users:
    $> activate tensorflow

4. install tensorflow 
    For GPU users:
    $> pip install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu
    
    For CPU users:
    $> pip install --upgrade tensorflow
    
    * you may found your pip broken after installing tensorflow. It is because
    tensorflow replaced your html5lib to an older version. use conda to fix it.
    
    $> conda install html5lib
    
5. install graphviz (for Keras):
    https://www.graphviz.org/
    
6. install hdf5, graphviz and pydot in python (for keras):
    $> pip install --upgrade hdf5
    $> pip install graphviz
    $> pip install pydot
    
6. install keras:
    $> pip install --updrade keras 
    

7. install scikit learn (will be used sometimes):
    http://scikit-learn.org/stable/

    $> pip install -U scikit-learn


8. To activate or deactivate Python envoriment:
    GPU user:
    $> activate tensorflow-gpu 
    
    CPU user:
    $> activate tensorflow
    
    * replace "activate" to "deactivate" if you want deactivate the envoriment.
    
9. Test:
    Try "import keras" in Python, if there is no error message, your are all set.
