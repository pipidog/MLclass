# Welcome to Deep Learning Zoo
This repo is the course website of my deep learning class: **Deep Learning Zoo**
at Physics Department, UC Davis. Each week I will introduce several deep learning
topics, from beginning to advanced. Participants are mostly PhD students or 
researchers who want to use deep learning techniques in their research fields.

Each week I will also prepare a few codes to demonstrate the concepts. Most of
our code are based on **Tensorflow** and **Keras**. If you have further 
questions, please email to spi@ucdavis.edu.

Note that deep learning can hugely speed up by using GPU. Therefore, if you have
nVidia GPUs, it is strongly recommend to use GPUs as backend.
