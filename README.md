# What is this?
This repo is the course website of my deep learning class: Deep Learning Zoo
at Physics Department, UC Davis. Each week I will introduce several deep learning
topics, from beginning to advanced. Participants are mostly PhD students or 
researchers who want to use deep learning techniques in their research fields.

Each week I will also prepare a few codes to demonstrate the concepts. Most of
our code are based on Tensorflow and Keras. If you have further questions, please 
email to spi@ucdavis.edu.
